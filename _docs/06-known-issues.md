At present Berserk only provide a forum rather than a proper issue/bug tracker.

Forums are not a good solution for tracking bugs, as such the community is maintaining our own issue list that we hope is easier to navigate and keep up-to-date.

If you want to report a bug, rather than just document its existence, it's recommended that you open an issue in the community bug tracker (after ensuring the same issue doesn't already exist), then make a post in the relevant Berserk forum linking out to the issue in the community bug tracker.
