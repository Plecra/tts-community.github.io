We've created this GitHub organization as a place to gather and share knowledge about creating mods for [Tabletop Simulator](http://berserk-games.com/tabletop-simulator/).

We'll be focusing heavily on the technical aspects of developing mods, in particular Lua scripting. However, we will cover other related topics when it makes sense to do so.

This is a community maintained project â€“ we have no affiliation with [Berserk Games](http://berserk-games.com/) (the developer of Tabletop Simulator).
